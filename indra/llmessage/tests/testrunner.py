def freeport(portlist, expr):
    """
    Find a free server port to use. Specifically, evaluate 'expr' (a
    callable(port)) until it stops raising EADDRINUSE exception.

    Pass:

    portlist: an iterable (e.g. xrange()) of ports to try. If you exhaust the
    range, freeport() lets the socket.error exception propagate. If you want
    unbounded, you could pass itertools.count(baseport), though of course in
    practice the ceiling is 2^16-1 anyway. But it seems prudent to constrain
    the range much more sharply: if we're iterating an absurd number of times,
    probably something else is wrong.

    expr: a callable accepting a port number, specifically one of the items
    from portlist. If calling that callable raises socket.error with
    EADDRINUSE, freeport() retrieves the next item from portlist and retries.

    Returns: (expr(port), port)

    port: the value from portlist for which expr(port) succeeded

    Raises:

    Any exception raised by expr(port) other than EADDRINUSE.

    socket.error if, for every item from portlist, expr(port) raises
    socket.error. The exception you see is the one from the last item in
    portlist.

    StopIteration if portlist is completely empty.

    Example:

    class Server(HTTPServer):
        # If you use BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer, turning off this flag is
        # essential for proper operation of freeport()!
        allow_reuse_address = False
    # ...
    server, port = freeport(xrange(8000, 8010),
                            lambda port: Server(("localhost", port),
                                                MyRequestHandler))
    # pass 'port' to client code
    # call server.serve_forever()
