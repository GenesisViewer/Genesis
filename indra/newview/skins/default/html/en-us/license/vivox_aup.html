	user’s failure to comply with the Policy. The user acknowledges

	user, including diagnostic information sent automatically after a
	problem or error, and agrees to such access and use.</P>

	<LI><P>ENFORCEMENT OF THIS POLICY: Vivox
	does not routinely monitors the activity of Service accounts for
	violation of this Policy. Vivox reserves the right at any time to
	monitor usage, transmissions, and content from time to time to
	operate the Service; to identify violations of this Policy; and/or
	to protect the network, the Service and/or other users. If the
	Service is used in a way that Vivox, in their sole discretion,
	believe violate this Policy, it may take any responsive actions they
	deem appropriate, including, but are not limited to, the immediate
	suspension or termination of all or any portion of the Service.
	Vivox will have no liability for any of these responsive actions.
	These actions are not exclusive remedies and Vivox may take any
	other legal or technical action deemed appropriate. The user
	expressly authorizes Vivox to cooperate with (i) law enforcement
	authorities in the investigation of suspected legal violations, and
	(ii) any system administrators at other Internet service providers
	or other network or computing facilities in order to enforce this
	Policy. This cooperation may include making available personally
	identifiable information about users to law enforcement or system
	administrators. The failure to enforce this Policy, for whatever
	reason or for no reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of any
	right to do so at any time. The user agrees that if any portion of
	this Policy is held invalid or unenforceable, such portion will be
	construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible, and
	the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. The
	user agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Vivox and its
	affiliates, suppliers, providers, and agents against all claims and
	expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) resulting from users
	engaging in any of the prohibited activities listed in this Policy
	or resulting from users violating the Policy or any other posted
	policy related to the Service. The foregoing user indemnification
	will survive any termination of the user’s agreements with Vivox .</P>
	<LI><P>ARBITRATION. Except for the right
	of a party to seek equitable relief, any disputes arising under or
	related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), excluding any Dispute
	relating to the validity or infringement of any intellectual
	property right, will be resolved by negotiation, mediation and, if
	necessary, arbitration, as follows. The party raising such Dispute
	will promptly advise the other party in writing describing in
	reasonable detail the nature of such Dispute (“Notice of
	Dispute”). The parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve the
	Dispute, but if they have not done so within thirty (30) days, the
	parties will submit the Dispute to a mutually agreed mediation
	organization. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute
	within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Notice of Dispute, then
	the Dispute will be resolved by a single arbitrator in a final and
	binding arbitration under the then current procedural rules of the
	American Arbitration Association. All proceedings will be conducted
	in the English language in Boston, Massachusetts. The arbitrator
	will have no power to modify the terms or conditions of this
	Agreement, or to award punitive damages. Any award rendered in such
	arbitration may be enforced by either party in any Court of
	competent jurisdiction.</P>
	<LI><P>GENERAL TERMS. This Agreement is
	governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. No
	agency, partnership, joint venture, employment or franchise
	relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. This AUP
	constitute the entire agreement between the parties concerning the
	use of the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is found to
	be unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the least extent
	needed to make the provision enforceable; the remaining terms of
	this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Vivox reserves
	the right to disclose any information about any user as required by
	a court order or as recommended by counsel in the context of any
	action by any government entity or other third party.</P>
	<LI><P>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY. Vivox may
	revise its Acceptable Use Policy from time to time without prior
	notice. Any changes will be presented in the latest version at the
	Vivox web site. All revised copies of the Policy are effective
	immediately upon a user’s first use of the Service after the
	change has been posted.</P>
