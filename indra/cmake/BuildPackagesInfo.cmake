# packages-formatter.py runs autobuild install --versions, which needs to know
# the build_directory, which (on Windows) depends on AUTOBUILD_ADDRSIZE.
# Within an autobuild build, AUTOBUILD_ADDRSIZE is already set. But when
# building in an IDE, it probably isn't. Set it explicitly using
# run_build_test.py.
